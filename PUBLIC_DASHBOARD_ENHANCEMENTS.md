## 📝 Technical Details

### **Database Relationships**

```sql
kemri_projects
  ├── departmentId → kemri_departments
  ├── finYearId → kemri_financialyears
  └── id → kemri_project_subcounties → kemri_subcounties
      └── id → kemri_project_wards → kemri_wards
```

### **Query Optimization**

- Uses `GROUP_CONCAT` for multiple geographic associations
- `LEFT JOIN` ensures all departments/subcounties show
- `HAVING` clause filters out empty departments
- `DISTINCT` prevents duplicate rows from multiple joins

### **Component Architecture**

```
DashboardPage
├── StatCard (x4) - Quick stats
├── Tabs Component
│   ├── Tab 1: DepartmentSummaryTable
│   │   └── DepartmentProjectsModal
│   └── Tab 2: SubCountySummaryTable
│       └── SubCountyProjectsModal
```
