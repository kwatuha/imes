# Public Feedback Response System

## ✅ Implementation Complete

This document describes the new feedback response system that allows county staff to respond to public feedback from within the protected admin dashboard.

## Overview

The system creates a complete feedback loop where:
1. **Citizens** submit feedback via the public dashboard (http://165.22.227.234:5174/public-feedback)
2. **County Staff** review and respond to feedback via the protected admin dashboard (http://165.22.227.234:5173/feedback-management)
3. **Responses** are automatically displayed on the public feedback page for accountability

- **Real-time Statistics**
  - Total feedback count
  - Pending review count
  - Responded count  
  - Under review count

- **Advanced Filtering**
  - Search by citizen name, project name, or feedback content
  - Filter by status: All, Pending, Under Review, Responded, Archived
  - Pagination for large datasets

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints**

Added two new protected endpoints to `/api/routes/publicRoutes.js`:

#### **PUT /api/public/feedback/:id/respond**
Submit or update a response to citizen feedback.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "admin_response": "Your official response text",
  "responded_by": 123
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Response submitted successfully"
}
```

#### **PUT /api/public/feedback/:id/status**
Update feedback status without adding a response.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "status": "reviewed"
}
```

**Valid Status Values:**
- `pending` - Initial state when feedback is submitted
- `reviewed` - Staff has reviewed but not yet responded
- `responded` - Official response has been provided
- `archived` - Feedback is complete and archived

### 3. **Navigation Integration**

The feedback management page has been added to the sidebar navigation under the **Administration** section:

- **Location**: Sidebar > Administration > Feedback Management
- **Icon**: Comment icon
- **Access Control**: Available to users with `feedback.respond` privilege OR admin users
- **Route**: `/feedback-management`

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The system uses the existing `public_feedback` table with the following relevant fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public_feedback (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(50),
    subject VARCHAR(500),
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    project_id INT,
    status ENUM('pending', 'reviewed', 'responded', 'archived') DEFAULT 'pending',
    admin_response TEXT,
    responded_by INT,
    responded_at DATETIME,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES kemri_projects(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (responded_by) REFERENCES kemri_users(id)
);
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**
   - All response endpoints require valid session
   - No anonymous responses possible

2. **Authorization Checks**
   - Privilege-based access control
   - Admin role has full access
   - Can be extended with granular privileges

3. **Input Validation**
   - Response text is required
   - Status values are validated
   - SQL injection protection via parameterized queries

4. **Audit Trail**
   - `responded_by` field tracks who responded
   - `responded_at` timestamp for accountability
   - `updated_at` tracks all changes
