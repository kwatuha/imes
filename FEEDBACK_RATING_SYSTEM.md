# 🌟 5-Point Likert Scale Rating System - IMPLEMENTED!

## ✨ Enhanced Citizen Feedback with Structured Ratings

Your public feedback system now includes a comprehensive **5-point Likert scale rating system** that provides quantifiable, structured data for analyzing citizen sentiment on county projects.

---

## 🎯 What's New

### **Structured Rating Questions**
Citizens can now rate projects on 5 key dimensions using a 1-5 scale:

1. **Overall Satisfaction/Support for the Project**
   - Measures general approval of the project's concept and execution
   - Scale: Strongly Oppose (1) → Strongly Support (5)

2. **Perceived Impact on Personal/Community Quality of Life**
   - Assesses anticipated or actual effect on resident well-being
   - Scale: Highly Negative Impact (1) → Highly Positive Impact (5)

3. **Alignment with Community Needs and Priorities**
   - Determines if the project addresses genuine community needs
   - Scale: Not Aligned at All (1) → Perfectly Aligned (5)

4. **Implementation/Supervision**
   - Measures citizen satisfaction with how implementation committees/teams managed the process
   - Scale: Very Poor Implementation (1) → Excellent Implementation (5)

5. **Confidence in the Project's Timeline and Budget (Feasibility)**
   - Gauges trust in the county's ability to complete on time and budget
   - Scale: Very Low Confidence (1) → Very High Confidence (5)
