## 🎯 How It Works

### Department Chart with Aliases

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 18,
  "department": "Ministry of Lands, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development",
  "departmentAlias": "Infrastructure",
  "project_count": 3,
  "total_budget": "225000000.00"
}
```

**Chart Display:**
- **X-Axis Label**: "Infrastructure" (short alias)
- **Tooltip on Hover**: "Ministry of Lands, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development" (full name)
- **Click**: Opens modal showing all Infrastructure projects

### Implementation:
```javascript
<BarChart 
  data={departmentStats.slice(0, 5).map(dept => ({
    ...dept,
    displayName: dept.departmentAlias || dept.department,  // Use alias or fallback
    fullName: dept.department                               // Store full name
  }))}
>
  <XAxis dataKey="displayName" />  {/* Shows alias */}
  <Tooltip 
    labelFormatter={(label, payload) => {
      return payload[0].payload.fullName;  {/* Shows full name */}
    }}
  />
  <Bar onClick={handleDepartmentClick} cursor="pointer" />
</BarChart>
```

## 💡 Department Alias Fallback

If a department doesn't have an alias:
```javascript
displayName: dept.departmentAlias || dept.department
```

The chart will use:
1. **Alias** if available (e.g., "Health", "Agriculture")
2. **Full name** if alias is NULL (fallback)

This ensures all departments display correctly!
